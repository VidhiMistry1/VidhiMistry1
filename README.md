# 👋 Hi, I'm Vidhi Mistry

## 👷‍♀️ Quality Engineering Specialist | 🎓 MS in Statistical Analytics | 🔍 Process Optimization & Data Insights

Hello! I'm Vidhi Mistry, a quality-focused engineering professional with a background in mechanical engineering and over 5 years of hands-on experience in manufacturing, quality assurance, and process improvement. I recently completed my Master's in Statistical Analytics from Northeastern University, where I explored how data can drive meaningful decisions in engineering systems.

I’m passionate about combining structured quality methodologies with the power of data analytics to drive operational excellence, improve supplier performance, and reduce inefficiencies across the production lifecycle.

## 🧩 My Journey

### 🏭 From Shop Floor to Strategy  
I started my career on the shop floor — implementing root cause analysis, reducing scrap, and leading quality audits. Over time, I moved into managing cross-functional quality teams, implementing ISO-compliant QMS, and leading large-scale defect reduction and continuous improvement initiatives.

### 📊 The Shift to Data  
Curiosity led me to analytics. While managing KPIs, quality dashboards, and audits, I realized the potential of data to uncover patterns and prevent issues before they occur. This drove me to pursue formal training in statistical methods, machine learning, and data visualization tools — so I could solve problems better, faster, and smarter.
